The entities are directly placed in the array, rather than allocated with
ED_Alloc, because otherwise an error loading the map would have entity
number references out of order.

Creates a server's entity / program execution context by
parsing textual entity definitions out of an ent file.

Used for both fresh maps and savegame loads.  A fresh map would also need
to call ED_CallSpawnFunctions () to let the objects initialize themselves.
